## 🧠 About Me

I'm a data analyst who believes every dataset has a story — and my job is to find the chapter that changes the business. With **3+ years of experience** turning ambiguous questions into clear, data-driven answers, I specialize in **customer analytics**, **operational efficiency**, and **predictive modeling**.

My approach is simple: **start with "why does this matter?"** before writing a single line of code. This ensures every analysis delivers impact, not just charts.

When I'm not wrangling data, you'll find me playing chess ♟️, experimenting with film photography 📷, or trying to perfect my homemade ramen recipe 🍜.
